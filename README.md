I was going through old code to commit to my GitHub to save for the future, and I found these three separate versions of Chess that I programmed ages ago.  Nothing is particularly new or impressive about these implementations of Chess and I know for certain that I could (and have) written much, much better versions now.  But I remember my first time writing Chess in Java as the first project that made me fall in love with programming, so I decided to include these three iterations as a sinlge repo, mostly for nostalgia.

I also think that these three initial versions of Chess that I wrote all the way back in 2017 really demonstrate how much my skill with programming has improved since I started.  You can see that, even though these programs are quite large, I still decided to include everything into a single file--most likely because I did not know how to separate a java project into multiple files.  Additionally, in the early implementations of Chess, I didn't undersand OOP very well, so instead of writin a class for each piece (like I did in the CSharpChess repo), I just wrote multiple methods for each piece to determine the moves for that piece.  

(I also included the first TicTacToe program I wrote, as well, because I remember that project as a precursor to my Chess programs).
